### Executive Summary


### Lucidchart
Messing around with lucid chart gave me more experince and knowledge about it. It showd me the differnt types of sysmbols and how they work and what they do. Seen many eexamples so i can get the habg of it. Leraend the many shortcuts and how to input different things to make charts.
### Introduction to Networking
#### Data Transmission 
Packet's is a unit of data that is transmitted over the internet. Each packet has the senderâ€™s address, the destination address, a sequence number, and a piece of the overall message to be sent. Different packets in a single message can take a variety of routes to the destination and they can arrive at different times. Packet-switching is a technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address. When any message packets are sent on the Internet ,routers try to find the optimal route for each packet. After the packet finds the destination the packets are re made to the original message for the recipient. Every device in the internet has a Unique identifying number aslo know has an IP address. An IP address has a format of four numbers with values ranging from 0 and 255 separated by a period. That is know as an IPV4 but after time passed the IPV4 wont be enough and will change to IPV6. The DNS is a directory of IP address common names. When a request to access a host with a domain name is given the DNS server is queried. An Example of a DNS is, 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com.The gives back the IP adress that the host requested. A protcol is a the set of rules that control how communications take place on a network. A example of a protcol is a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) are the communication rules for transferring files from one host to another.
#### Network Hardware
A switch is similar to a hub but its more intelligent. A hub just knows only when you plug in a cable to the port. But a switch can learn and understand the physical address of the device that's connected to it. The address's that they store into it is called a MAC address. When a data packet is sent to a switch it is directed to the intended destination port. Unlike the Hub which directs it to all 4 of the ports. An example of a switch is if 2 computers wanted to communicate to each other the computer send the data to a switch and teh switch finds the mac address to the recipient computer and sends the data just to that computer, unlike a hub which sends it to all the computers. Hubs and switches are used to exchange data within a local area netwrok such is a home netwrok or in a business. They can't exchange data outside of thier own network. A router is a device that routes or forwards data from one netwrok to another. A hub and a switch can't read IP address  so they can't exchange data outide of thier network. A router can read IP address so that's when it comes to help. If you want data from other networks then you need a router which has the capabilities of doing it when a hub and a switch can't.
#### Network Topologies
A topology is the layout of how a network communicates with different devices. The downside of a star topology is if the central hub or switch then all the computers on that central point would be affected this is known as a single point of failure. The main topology that experiences a single point of failure is a star topology. An infrastructure topology uses a combination of wired and wireless devices. The computers in an infrastructure are physically connected to a switch. A infrastructure also has a wireless access point that is connected to the switch which is used for wireless devices. A wireless mesh topology is simialr to a wired mesh topology. Where devices are interconnected with each other but with an exception that they are wirelessly interconnected. In my opinion i think the wireless mesh topology is better because they send data wirelessly which means less cables and less money and time to add the cables.
